After your quick victory, you realize who you are!
You are a Welsh spearman of the Kingdom of Dumnonia who has been taken prisoner after your shield wall was broken in battle...
You comrades and fellow spearmen were all killed after the shield wall broke, and you were left unconscious.
The world is spinning, your head hurts, and you look up as blood drips from your nose.
